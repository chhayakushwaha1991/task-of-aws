1>create an ubuntu instance and take ssh of it
2>update the repository of ubuntu
 sudo apt update -y
3>Install s3fs from online software repositories
 sudo apt install s3fs -y
4> You need to generate the access key ID and secret access key in the AWS web interface for your account (IAM user). The IAM user must have S3 full access
5>Go back to the Ubuntu console to create a configuration file for storing the AWS access key and secret access key needed to mount an S3 bucket with S3FS.
  The command to do this is:
 echo ACCESS_KEY:SECRET_ACCESS_KEY > ~/.passwd-s3fs
6>Check whether the keys were written to the file:
 cat ~/.passwd-s3fs 
7> Set correct permissions for the passwd-s3fs file where the access keys are stored:
   chmod 600 ~/.passwd-s3fs
8>create a directory that will act as a mounting point for your s3 bucket.
 mkdir ~/s3-bucket
9>create a bucket named chhayakibucket and upload an object into it
10> Use the following command to set the bucket name, the path to the directory used as the mount point and the file that contains 
   the AWS access key and secret access key.
s3fs chhayakibucket ~/s3-bucket -o passwd_file=~/.passwd-s3fs
11> the bucket is mounted to check the mount point
df -h |grep bucket
12> Letâ€™s check the contents of the directory to which the bucket has been mounted:
  ls -al ~/s3-bucket 
13> u will see the object in the above directory that was in s3 bucket to see more u can add more files in that directory and u will see it in s3 bucket in console.
